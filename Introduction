Hello everyone! My name is Jayden Stack. I do already have had the pleasure of
meeting some of you already! It has been a lot of fun reading your message boards 
and learning the problems of RStudio and SAS together. I grew up in a small 
western Nebraska town called Chadron and graduated from Hastings College this 
past spring.I am very much looking forward to this class and meeting the rest of 
you and hopefully forming a solid raport that we will carry the rest of our 
college careers. 

I have experience using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.redux, React.js, and have 
dabbled in SQL as well as C#. I would not consider myself an expert in any of 
these languages, but would say the first few listed are my strongest. I am very interested in putting my sports background to use in analytics and learn more 
than just what goes on behind the scenes. I enjoy to golf and binge netflix shows.
I am so excited to see what is in store and developing relationships with the 
entire department.
